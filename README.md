# WS Tester

I had a project recently where one of the biggest challenges I encountered was how to test and troubleshoot the websocket connection. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t have this tool QUITE up to par with what I have now, but I thought I'd share so others can benefit as well.

It's just a simple html file with js embedded. Nothing fancy. The only server required is the one you're connecting to.

Nothing is sent to any of *my* servers or anything other than the server you put in.

To use, either download and open the html file in your browser or navigate to the [github pages](https://mredig.github.io/WSTester/) version of this repo.

Currently it only sends and receives text formatted messages (no binary etc), as im not sure how to do that with an html interface, but it should be simple enough to expand on if you're so inclined.
